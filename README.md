# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Classic Rock, Paper, and Scissors game implemented using OOP concepts.<br/>
To Run:
1) Initial screen is hard coded. It is testing Rock vs Paper. Output is 0 (meaning tool on the left side lost and right side won. Similarly, output is 1 when we test Rock vs Scissor indicating tool on the left side won and right side lost.

2) Next screen just tests the overloaded assignment operator. It is just assigning strength and type from one tool to another and printing to test the validity of assignment operator.

3) Main screen comes. Now you can play the classic game infinitely until you get bored (in which case you can press 'q' to quit)
